                BINARY BONUS
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg font-poppins text-justify">
                BI, which means for two, suggests that your account will have
                two teams: a left team and a right team. These teams are formed
                by combining your Left and Right. Binary profits can help you
                achieve steady income, mutual benefit, and continuous revenue.
                The purpose of binary income is to provide users with consistent
                income from affiliates and user groups in their network tree.
                <br />
                <br />
                Binary compensation consists of payments that are mutually
                exclusive. Binary fundamentals the structure of a compensation
                plan, when it comes to binary compensation structures, there are
                two possibilities for establishing a downline. Distributors can
                only place new recruits on the left or right side (or leg) of
                their downline. The most notable feature of a binary plan is
                that each distributor can only have up to two recruits on the
                first level beneath them. Any income of 10% earned above the
                capping limit shall be forfeited and users shall not be entitled
                to that part of binary earnings of the current day.
                <br />
                <br />
                Example - Assume a user on the right side of an active account
                contributes $43,000 and another on the left side invests $16,000
                <br />
                <br />
                Let's compute the binary.
                <br />
                <br />
                The maximum amount that can be matched is $16,000. So binary
                will be 10% of $16,000 = $1,600, and the remaining balance of
                $27,000 will be carried forward and matched in the future
                $27,000.
