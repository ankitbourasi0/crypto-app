              A digital currency, or cryptocurrency, is an alternative payment
              method developed utilising encryption methods. Because of the
              usage of encryption technology, cryptocurrencies are functional
              both as a medium of exchange and an electronic bookkeeping system.
              You need a wallet to use cryptocurrency. A global decentralised or
              over-the-counter market for the trading of currencies is the
              foreign exchange market. For every currency, exchange rates are
              set by this market. It covers every facet of purchasing, selling,
              and exchanging currency at the going rate.

              Some people have started to think that trading in forex and
              cryptocurrencies are essentially the same thing over time. Others,
              though, have come to think that there is a significant difference
              between the two.

          HOW COME CRYPTOCURRENCIES MATTER?
        </h3>
        
        <p className="text-lg font-poppins text-justify">
          Due to its decentralised nature, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies
          allow for peer-to-peer financial transactions and contract signing
          platforms. The current financial system may be overturned, and finance
          may become more democratic. Over the past few years, the size of the

          ANALYZING CRYPTO CHART
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg font-poppins text-justify">
          Most cryptocurrency price charts use candlesticks as their primary
          price indicator. Each candlestick stands for the cost. A green candle
          on the majority of cryptocurrency charts denotes a bullish trend or an
          increase in price, while a red candle signifies a bearish movement or
          a drop in price.

          A COMPARISON OF CRYPTO AND FOREX TRADING
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg font-poppins text-justify">
          Unlike cryptocurrencies, you can exit forex trades with ease. In the
          currency market, it is simple to exit a trade. Since 2019, the market
          price on a currency market has risen dramatically over time. You can
          easily withdraw or exit a trade when the price you arrive at during
          trading is closer to the one you see on the screen.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, once a cryptocurrency depreciates, it may be difficult for
          traders to exit the position, especially for the majority of coins,
          excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum.
          <br />
          <br />
          The market for cryptocurrencies is available for trade and investing.
          To invest is to make a currency purchase, with the intention of
          keeping it for a long time in the hope that its value would increase.

          Some investors are planning to trade for Bitcoin rather than buy it.
          Some investors don't plan to purchase Bitcoin but instead trade for
          the long term, using the tried-andtrue strategy of "buy low, sell
          high."
          <br />
          Cryptocurrencies are limited in supply since their circulation is
          managed by the industry's miners. It's also important to bring out the
          fact that crypto trading is accompanied by high market volatility.
          Currency prices fluctuate often on the market due to a number of
          variables, some of which are beyond of anyone's control. Overall, the
          cryptocurrency sector is growing, with Bitcoin at the forefront.
